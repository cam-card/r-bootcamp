# Welcome to Cameron's R Bootcamp

In this class we cover the basics of R programing using the Tidyverse. This includes basic R syntax, working with different file/data types, visualization and statistics. 

There are pages available with the content from each week including an activity/practice opportunity. The bootcamp is held in person on Tuesdays at 3:00 pm in NRD 307.
